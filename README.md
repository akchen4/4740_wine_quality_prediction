# Project: Wine Quality Prediction

This project assesses the performance of a variety of regression and classification methods in order to best predict the quality rating of a wine, given certain characteristics. This project was completed by myself and two other students at Cornell University (Jessica Han, '25 and Abby Kim, '24). The datasets used in this project were sourced from University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). 

## Contributions
My personal contributions can be found in the portion of 4740_modeling_wine_quality labeled "Non-subset selection regression methods." Methods used include random forests and bagging, Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), and shrinkage methods (ridge regression and lasso).
